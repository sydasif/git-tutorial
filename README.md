# A Beginner Guide to Git

Git is a version control system, used to track versions of a file, and helps collaborate with developers and work in a team.

It's decentralized in nature, helping the larger team to work together. Every developer has their own copy of the repository on their machine, they can locally work without the internet on their machine and commit their changes.

Once their work is done they can publish their changes on a remote git repository and share them with other developers.

You can also do a hands-on exercise(using GitHub) to practice git along with this thread as well.

Pre-requisite:

[Install Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

[Create an Account on GitHub](https://wikihow.com/Create-an-Account-on-GitHub)

[Create a repo](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/create-a-repo)

## git init

It initializes an empty repository as a git repository on your local machine.

As shown below, We've created an empty folder - `my-repo` and run the `git init` command to mark it as a git repository.

```console
[$] <> my-repo>git init
Initialized empty Git repository in ~/my-repo/.git/
```

Let's add an empty file - "script.js" in this local git folder - `my-repo`.

```console
[$] <> ~/my-repo (main)
$ ls
script.py
```

## git status

git status will show a list of all files along with their status.
Newly added files will be "untracked" by git initially.

It is the most frequent command we will use to see file status.

As shown below in the untracked file list we can see "script.py"

```console
[$] <> ~/my-repo (main)
$ git status 
On branch main

No commits yet

Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
        script.py

nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)
```

## git add

Out of all the untracked files, we can pick which file we want to commit. This is called staging. 

Use Below Command to stage a file:
`git add <file>`.

Below we've added `script.py` to the stage and then used git status to check its status.

```console
[$] <> ~/my-repo (main)
$ git add script.py 

[$] <> ~/my-repo (main)
$ git status
On branch main

No commits yet

Changes to be committed:
  (use "git rm --cached <file>..." to unstage)
        new file:   script.py
```

## git commit

Now, its time to commit the file to our local repository using 
`git commit -m <commit-message>`

Below we've committed the "script.js" file with a commit message.
Then we've used git status to see if our commit is successful or not.

```console
[$] <> ~/my-repo (main)
$ git commit -m "first commit"
[main (root-commit) 2664303] first commit
 1 file changed, 0 insertions(+), 0 deletions(-)
 create mode 100644 script.py

```

So far, we've committed the above file in our local repository only. Now it's time to push this file to remote repo.

If you remember, I've asked you to create a repo on GitHub in the prerequisite section. Now it's time to use it. Please get the link to your remote branch ready.

## git remote

Before sending our code to a remote repository, we need to map our local repo with equivalent remote repo by using the below command:

`git remote add origin <remote-repo-url>`

As shown below:

```console
[$] <> ~/my-repo (main)
$ git remote add origin git@github.com:sydasif/my-repo.git
```

## git push

At last, using the below push command we can send our file to the remote repo.

`git push origin <remote-branch-name>`

As shown below:

```console
[$] <> ~/my-repo (main)
$ git push -u origin main
Enumerating objects: 3, done.
Counting objects: 100% (3/3), done.
Writing objects: 100% (3/3), 210 bytes | 105.00 KiB/s, done.
Total 3 (delta 0), reused 0 (delta 0), pack-reused 0
To github.com:sydasif/my-repo.git
 * [new branch]      main -> main
branch 'main' set up to track 'origin/main'.

```

This was part 1 in the Git.

In this Part, we will see a scenario where:

Someone else wants to take your changes, add their changes on top of it and push those changes on the remote git repo.

## git clone

When you want to use a remote repo for the first time, you need to clone it first using the below command.

`git clone <remote-repo-url>`

We've cloned our previously created repository for the first time.

```console
[$] ~/Desktop
$ git clone https://github.com/sydasif/my-repo.git
Cloning into 'my-repo'...
remote: Enumerating objects: 6, done.
remote: Counting objects: 100% (6/6), done.
remote: Compressing objects: 100% (4/4), done.
remote: Total 6 (delta 0), reused 6 (delta 0), pack-reused 0
Receiving objects: 100% (6/6), done.
```

## git fetch

The below "git fetch" command retrieves the latest meta-data from the remote repo and updates the same in the local repo. 

`git fetch origin`

It doesnâ€™t do any file transferring. It just checks if there are any changes available or not.

```[Note]
In the current case it's optional to do git fetch because git clone will automatically update all metadata. But for later usage fetch will be very useful.
```

## git checkout

It helps to create a branch, a branch is your own copy of the remote repo where you will apply your changes and later push your changes to the remote repository.

`git checkout -b <branch-name>`

In our Eg:

```console
[$] <> ~/Desktop/my-repo (main)
$ git checkout -b first-branch
Switched to a new branch 'first-branch'

[$] <> ~/Desktop/my-repo (first-branch)
$
```

## git diff

We can check the changes made by us, using the below command:

`git diff <file-name>`

We've modified `script.py` in the new branch. Newly added lines will be shown with the `"+"` prefix and removed lines will be shown with the `"-"` prefix.

```console
[$] <> ~/Desktop/my-repo (first-branch)
$ git diff
warning: in the working copy of 'script.py', LF will be replaced by CRLF the next time Git touches it
diff --git a/script.py b/script.py
index e69de29..7df869a 100644
--- a/script.py
+++ b/script.py
@@ -0,0 +1 @@
+print("Hello, World!")
```

Now, using the following sequence of commands we can send our modified file to the remote repo:

```console
[$] <> ~/Desktop/my-repo (first-branch)
$ git add script.py 
warning: in the working copy of 'script.py', LF will be replaced by CRLF the next time Git touches it
```

```console
[$] <> ~/Desktop/my-repo (first-branch)
$ git commit -m "add code"
[first-branch 8245dcc] add code
 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)
```

```console
[$] <> ~/Desktop/my-repo (first-branch)
$ git push origin first-branch
Enumerating objects: 5, done.
Counting objects: 100% (5/5), done.
Delta compression using up to 4 threads
Compressing objects: 100% (2/2), done.
Writing objects: 100% (3/3), 295 bytes | 295.00 KiB/s, done.
Total 3 (delta 0), reused 0 (delta 0), pack-reused 0
remote: 
remote: Create a pull request for 'first-branch' on GitHub by visiting:
remote:      https://github.com/sydasif/my-repo/pull/new/first-branch
remote:
To https://github.com/sydasif/my-repo.git
 * [new branch]      first-branch -> first-branch
```

After this, our code will be added to the respective remote branch.

## git pull

Many times you are working on the same file on which someone else is also working. 

In such a case, before pushing our copy we need to get the latest copy of the same file. Add our changes to it and then push, to avoid any conflicts.

```console
[$] <> ~/Desktop/my-repo (first-branch)
$ git pull origin first-branch
From https://github.com/sydasif/my-repo
 * branch            first-branch -> FETCH_HEAD
Already up to date.
```

## Pull Request

In such a case, you need to raise a PR, go through the code review process and then merge your changes on the destination branch.

To Create PR:

[Creating a pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request)

After Review Merge PR:

[Merging a pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/incorporating-changes-from-a-pull-request/merging-a-pull-request)

Congratulations your changes are now in destination branch!
